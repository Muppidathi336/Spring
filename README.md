# Spring

#Purpose:
bring flexibility and loose-coupling and dynamic binding of the objects at runtime

#IoC
IoC refers to transferring the control of objects and their dependencies from the main program to a container or framework. 
Object instantiation by the constructor/class method/instance method. So can maintain the object creation separately from the code where they are referenced.

#DI
dependency injection=> dependency b/w the instances is injected by either xml/annotation/plain java. configuration or annotation decides which object to be used.
